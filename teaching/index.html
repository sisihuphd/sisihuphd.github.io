  		<p>I have two and a half years of teaching experience in the United States, in which I have solo-taught Strategic Communication Research for one year. 
        My teaching philosophy is centered around the idea that knowledge is best absorbed by students and most beneficial when it can be applied to real-world situations. 
        Therefore, in my teaching, I focus on the hands-on skills needed to work in a professional environment, such as account management skills, 
        marketing research skills, and journalist photo, audio, and video editing skills. My teaching is heavily influenced by my research in 
        strategic health communication and five years of professional experience in the advertising and magazine fields.</p>
