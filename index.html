	              <p>Hello! I am an assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Strategic Media at the University of Arkansas. 
			      I teach Advertising Principles, Campaigns, and Journalism Theory courses. I have five years of professional work experience 
			      in advertising and magazine fields that have heavily influenced my hands-on approach to teaching. </p>
			          
                      <p>My research is rooted in strategic communication with an emphasis on health and science communication. 
			      Topics I have recently examined include narrative persuasion and message strategies to reduce psychological reactance 
			      and promote desired health behavior.</p>
